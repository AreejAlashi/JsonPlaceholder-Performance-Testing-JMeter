# JsonPlaceholder-Performance-Testing-JMeter
This is a performance testing project performed entirely by me using JMeter, with full manual documentation.  I created CSV reports and analyzed duration, stress, and spike tests for the GET /posts and POST /posts endpoints.  The testing was performed on the "Json Placeholder" website
